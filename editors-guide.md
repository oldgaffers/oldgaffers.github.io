# Guide for Editors

This is a work-in-progress

## The Editing Process

The editing process has been designed to allow anyone to submit new or amended data and
pictures for a boat but nothing is committed to the register until an editor has approved it.

## Adding a boat

New boats are added by clicking on the link on the boat browser. This opens up a form (on Jotform.com)
which takes the user step through the process.

When a boat form is submitted an email to the boat register editors with three buttons:

  + a button to commit the changes to the register.
  + a button to edit the data before creating a new entry
  + a button to merge this data with an existing registry entry (this isn't implemented yet)

Pressing the first button creates a new entry in the register. If the form contains pictures a new SmugMug gallery is
automatically created and the pictures are uploaded to it.

Pressing the second button launches the form again with the data populated from the previous submission and
allows the editor to make changes to the data. Submitting the form sends another email to the editor who
is then likely to use the first button.
