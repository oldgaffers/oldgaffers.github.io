## Need Help with your boat register entry?

Our online forms are meant to be easy to fill in. They have lots of questions but you can skip all but a very few.
We have a [paper form](oga-boatregister-form-2019.pdf) you can print and write on and post it to us if you want.

Our email address is boatregister@oga.org.uk but if you would rather use the telephone or post then you can find our details in the OGA Yearbook.

## Report a problem with the website

You can use any of the same methods to contact us about technical problems or suggest improvements but we also have an online issue management
system at https://github.com/oldgaffers/boats/issues.
